# TERM-PAPER-G15

This repository contains the code and analysis for the term paper of Group 15 in the TECH2 course at BEDS. The project focuses on analyzing survey data to understand various economic expectations and behaviors. 

The project merges monthly SCE data, cleans and structures it, and explores:  
- differences in expectations by gender, education, and numeracy  
- how expectations evolve over time and around key events  
- correlations between expected and realized inflation  

Run in the provided **TECH2 Anaconda environment**.  
Deliverable: one Jupyter notebook that runs without errors.

## The use of AI and Online Sources: (This section is also at the bottom of the notebook)
Throughout this assignment, we relied on a variety of online resources to improve the efficiency, clarity, and precision of our code. For general programming issues—such as managing data frames in Pandas, debugging, and refining visualization syntax—we referred to Stack Overflow and the official documentation for Pandas and Matplotlib. These helped us apply recognized best practices in data handling and presentation.  

We also made use of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to support the coding and writing process. These tools assisted in structuring the workflow, resolving logic errors, and implementing advanced plotting functions, including the integration of intersection points between event markers and line charts. Additionally, we used them for spelling and grammar checks in explanatory and conclusion sections to improve readability and coherence.  

All AI-generated suggestions were critically reviewed, modified, and tested to ensure alignment with the assignment requirements and our own analytical approach. External inputs served only as guidance; the final implementation and analysis fully reflect our independent understanding and interpretation of the tasks. We have included comments in the code cells to indicate where AI assistance was utilized.
